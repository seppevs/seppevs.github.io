![Me](http://en.gravatar.com/userimage/1518376/11c6db76bdc180db73b99798ad42be30.jpg?size=500 "Me")

I'm a freelance software developer with 10 years of experience in Java enterprise application development.

Since early 2014, I'm exploring the wonderful world of Node.js and JavaScript.

I always had a very broad interest in computer technology, so I probably won't blog only on Node.js & JavaScript.
