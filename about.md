![Me](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/fa32e43c5ee072a072cc26478ed55f3e?size=300 "Me")

I'm a freelance software developer with 10 years of experience in Java enterprise application development.

Since early 2014, I'm exploring the wonderful world of Node.js and JavaScript.

I always had a very broad interest in computer technology, so I probably won't blog only on Node.js & JavaScript.
